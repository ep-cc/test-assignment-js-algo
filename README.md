# Algorithms in Javascript
## Assignment 1.

Implement the `solve` function in the starter code file `solution.js` to
compute and return the sum of two largest elements of an array. If the array
has only one element, return that as answer. If the array is empty, return zero.

You don't have to check if the given argument is an array or not.

## Examples

- Input: `[3, 6, 2, 9]`; output: `15`
- Input: `[]`; output: `0`
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`; output: `9`
- Input: `[42]`; output: `42`
